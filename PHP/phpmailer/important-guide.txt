IMPORTANT GUIDE:
================

* First of all, turn on 2 Step verification on your google account.

* Set app password in your gmail.

* In case if you unable to find app password option,
  use this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

* Gmail will auto-generate your app password.

* Download PHPMailer. Recommended link: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

* Extract it inside your main project folder.

* Define namespaces at the top of your code.
=> use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
=> use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
=> use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

* Include required PHPMailer files
=> require 'uploades/PHPMailer.php';
=> require 'uploades/SMTP.php';
=> require 'uploades/Exception.php';

* Create instance of "PHPMailer" ==> $mail = new PHPMailer();

* Now set PHPMailer properties with their required values. 

* Note: Assign your gmail "app password" (not your gmail password) to Password property.

* Example: $mail->Password = "YourAppPassword";

* Note: setFrom() method takes two parameters,
  1st is sender email,
  2nd is sender name which is optional. You can skip 2nd parameter.

(i)  $mail->setFrom('usmanhameed1790@gmail.com','Usman Hameed'); 
     OR 
(ii) $mail->setFrom('usmanhameed1790@gmail.com');

* Incase if you need to send or use emojis in your mail then,
  set value 'UTF-8' to CharSet property.

* Example: $mail->CharSet = 'UTF-8';

* Note: (i)  Assign value of "smtp.gmail.com" to 'Host' property,
             (If you are using PHPMailer on localhost). 

        (ii) Assign value of your website domain to 'Host' property,
             (If you are using PHPMailer on a live website).

* Example: 

    $mail->Host = "smtp.gmail.com"; (For localhost).
    OR
    $mail->Host = "madalphadesigners.com"; (For live website).


* You can send mail to multiple recipients using PHPMailer by looping through your email addresses,
  and adding each recipient one by one.

* Example:

    $email_Addresses = array("recipient1@gmail.com", "recipient2@gmail.com", "recipient3@gmail.com");

    foreach($email_Addresses as $i)
    {
      $mail->addAddress($i);
    }
    $mail->send();
