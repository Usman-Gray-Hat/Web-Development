POST MESSAGE:

* window.opener.postMessage() is a method in JavaScript that allows communication between two windows
  or tabs that are controlled by the same domain.

* It is used to send a message from a child window to its parent window.

* The child window executes the window.opener.postMessage method with the message to send
  as the first parameter, and the target origin as the second parameter.

* The parent window can listen for the message event by adding an event listener to the window object.
  The listener function will be called when a message is received.

* When the listener function is called, it can access the message data through the event.data property.

* Note: In jQuery, use this syntax $(window).on('message',function(e){}); instead of addEventListener.

* Note that the target origin parameter is used to specify the domain that the message should be sent to.
  This is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

* In summary, window.opener.postMessage is a useful method for allowing communication between windows or tabs
  that are under the same domain control, and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as passing data
  or triggering actions.
