  class: .navbar-expand-sm|md|lg|xl|xxl (stacks the navbar vertically on XXlarge, Extra large,

  then add <li> elements with a .nav-item class followed by an <a> element with a .nav-link class.

* Remove the .navbar-expand class to create a navigation bar that will always be vertical.

* Add the .justify-content-center class to center the navigation bar links.

* Note: .justify-content-center class cannot work with container-fluid. So remove container-fluid
  div if you want to center your navbar links.

* Use any of the bg-color classes to change the background color of the navbar. 
  (bg-primary, bg-success, bg-dark, bg-light, bg-info, bg-secondary, bg-danger, bg-warning) etc.

  .navbar-light class within <nav> element to add a black text color.

  or the .disabled class to indicate that the link is un-clickable.
