BOOTSTRAP 5 ANIMATON CLASSES:
=============================

*  Here are some of the animation classes that Bootstrap provides:

-> animate__animated: This class is required for all animations.
   You should add this class to the element you want to animate.

-> animate__bounce: This class will make the element bounce.

-> animate__flash: This class will make the element flash.

-> animate__pulse: This class will make the element pulse.

-> animate__rubberBand: This class will make the element rubber band.

-> animate__shakeX: This class will make the element shake horizontally.

-> animate__shakeY: This class will make the element shake vertically.

-> animate__headShake: This class will make the element shake its head.

-> animate__swing: This class will make the element swing.

-> animate__tada: This class will make the element tada.

-> animate__wobble: This class will make the element wobble.

-> animate__jello: This class will make the element jello.

-> animate__heartBeat: This class will make the element beat like a heart.

-> animate__fadeIn: This class will give the element fadeIn effect.

-> animate__fadeOut: This class will give the element fadeOut effect.

-> animate__zoomIn: This class will give the element zoomIn effect.

-> animate__zoomOut: This class will give the element zoomOut effect.

* To use these classes, simply add them to the element you want to animate,
  along with the animate__animated class. For example:

  <div class="animate__animated animate__bounce">This element will bounce</div>

===========================
ANIMATION DURATION & DELAY:
===========================

* You can also control the duration and delay of the animation by using the
  animate__duration-* and animate__delay-* classes.

* For example, to make an animation last for 2 seconds,
  you can add the class animate__duration-2s to the element.

* To add a delay of 1 second before the animation starts,
  you can add the class animate__delay-1s to the element.
